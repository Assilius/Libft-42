C Standard Library Functions and String Manipulation Extensions
Welcome to the comprehensive C Standard Library Functions and String Manipulation Extensions repository! As part of the esteemed 42 project, this repository houses an extensive collection of fundamental C standard library functions along with additional utility functions tailored to enhance string manipulation capabilities.

Key Features:

    Standard Library Functions:
        isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, isascii, isprint: Functions for character classification.
        strlen: Calculates the length of a string.
        memset, bzero: Memory manipulation functions to set memory blocks.
        memcpy, memmove: Memory copy and move operations.
        strchr, strrchr, strncmp, memchr, memcmp, strnstr: String search and comparison functions.
        atoi: Converts a string to an integer.

    Memory Allocation and String Duplication:
        calloc: Allocates memory for an array and initializes it with zero.
        strdup: Duplicates a string in memory.

    Extended String Manipulation Functions:
        ft_substr: Extracts a substring from a string.
        ft_strjoin: Concatenates two strings.
        ft_strtrim: Trims whitespace characters from the beginning and end of a string.
        ft_split: Splits a string into an array of substrings.
        ft_itoa: Converts an integer to a string.
        ft_strmapi: Applies a function to each character of a string.
        ft_striteri: Iterates through the characters of a string with an index.

    Output Functions:
        ft_putchar_fd: Outputs a character to a specified file descriptor.
        ft_putstr_fd: Outputs a string to a specified file descriptor.
        ft_putendl_fd: Outputs a string followed by a newline to a specified file descriptor.
        ft_putnbr_fd: Outputs an integer to a specified file descriptor.

These functions serve as an indispensable toolkit for C programmers, offering efficiency, reliability, and compatibility. Whether you're embarking on system-level programming, developing applications, or honing your algorithmic skills, this repository provides essential tools to empower your journey in the world of C programming.
